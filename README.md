# MUD Pretty Printer

This code is a little on the early side.  It functions in two ways:

* It can be called with a web forms POST interface
* You can send it a raw MUD file

Either way, it will output human readable text, describing the ACLs in the MUD file.

If it breaks, don't blame me.  It's early code.  You can try a running version of it at
